# Go on Airplanes ✈️

**Go on Airplanes** is an organization focused on building modern, fast, and minimal web tooling in Go — starting with the **GoA Core** framework.

Created by [@kleeedolinux](https://github.com/kleeedolinux), the project lead and main maintainer, GoA aims to bring the developer experience of file-based routing (à la Next.js) to Go, without the weight and complexity of Node.js-based frameworks.

## 🧠 What We Do

- 🧩 Build lightweight and extensible tools in pure Go  
- ⚡ Focus on performance, simplicity, and modern patterns  
- ✍️ Promote clean, file-based routing for web apps  
- 🔧 Offer a minimal alternative to bloated JavaScript frameworks

> 🚧 Go on Airplanes is an evolving project — contributions, ideas, and collaboration are always welcome!
