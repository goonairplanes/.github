# Go on Airplanes ✈️

**Go on Airplanes** is an organization focused on building modern, fast, and minimal web tooling in Go — starting with the **GoA Core** framework.

Created by [@kleeedolinux](https://github.com/kleeedolinux), the project lead and main maintainer, GoA aims to bring the developer experience of file-based routing (à la Next.js) to Go, without the weight and complexity of Node.js-based frameworks.
